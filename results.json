In this paper, we have performed a data collection process identifying more than 872000 different Bitcoin nodes. This data allows us to present information on the size of the Bitcoin P2P network, the node geographic distribution, the network stability in terms of interrupted availability of nodes, as well as some data regarding the propagation time of the transmitted information. Furthermore, although not every Bitcoin user can be identified as a P2P network node, measurements of the P2P network can be considered as a lower bound for Bitcoin usage, and they provide interesting results on the adoption of such virtual currency.",

Such mistrust may be a deadlock point in a trade transaction where the buyer does not want to perform the payment until the seller sends the goods and the seller does not want to do so until the buyer pays for the purchase. In this paper we present a fair protocol for data trading where the commercial deal, in terms of delivering the data and performing the payment, is atomic, since the seller cannot redeem the payment unless the buyer obtains the data and the buyer cannot obtain the data without performing the payment. The protocol is based on Bitcoin scripting language and the fairness of the protocol can be probabilistically enforced.",

From the viewpoint of network measurement, we would like to observe this topology so we can characterize its performance, fairness and robustness. However, this is difficult because Bitcoin is deliberately designed to hide its topology from onlookers. Knowledge of the topology is not in itself a vulnerability, although it could conceivably help an attacker performing targeted eclipse attacks or to deanonymize transaction senders.In this paper we present TxProbe, a novel technique for reconstructing the Bitcoin network topology. TxProbe makes use of peculiarities in how Bitcoin processes out of order, or “orphaned” transactions. We conducted experiments on Bitcoin testnet that suggest our technique reconstructs topology with precision and recall surpassing 90%. We also used TxProbe to take a snapshot of the Bitcoin testnet in just …",

        "abstract": "Bitcoin has emerged as the most successful cryptocurrency since its appearance back in 2009. However, its main drawback to become a truly global payment system is its low capacity in transaction throughput. At present time, some ideas have been proposed to increase the transaction throughput, with different impact on the scalability of the system. Some of these ideas propose to decouple standard transactions from the blockchain core and to manage them through a parallel payment network, relegating the usage of the bitcoin blockchain only to transactions which consolidate multiple of those off-chain movements. Such mechanisms generate new actors in the bitcoin payment scenario, the Payment Service Providers, and new privacy issues arise regarding bitcoin users. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive description of the most relevant scalability solutions proposed for the bitcoin network and we …",

It is composed of a peer-to-peer network, used to transfer raw information data. Some of the links in the peer-to-peer network are identified as payment channels, used to conduct payments between two Lightning Network clients (i.e., the two nodes of the channel). Payment channels are created with a fixed credit amount, the channel capacity. The channel capacity, together with the IP address of the nodes, is published to allow a routing algorithm to find an existing path between two nodes that do not have a direct payment channel. However, to preserve users' privacy, the precise balance of the pair of nodes of a given channel (i.e. the bandwidth of the channel in each direction), is kept secret. Since balances are not announced, second-layer nodes probe routes iteratively, until they find a successful route to the …",

Fast payments are desirable in certain scenarios, for instance, when buying in vending machines, fast food restaurants, or withdrawing from an ATM. Despite being quickly propagated through the network, zero-confirmation transactions are not protected against double-spending attacks, since the double-spending protection Bitcoin offers relies on the blockchain and, by definition, such transactions are not yet included in it. In this paper, we propose a double-spending prevention mechanism for Bitcoin zero-confirmation transactions.

Cryptocurrency P2P networks have new characteristics that propose new challenges and avoid some problems of existing P2P networks. By characterizing the most relevant cryptocurrency network, Bitcoin, we provide details on different properties of cryptocurrency networks and their similarities and differences with standard P2P network paradigms. Our study allows us to conclude that cryptocurrency networks present a new paradigm of P2P networks due to the mechanisms they use to achieve high resilience and security. With this new paradigm, interesting research lines can be further developed, both in the focused field of P2P cryptocurrency networks and also when such networks are combined with other distributed scenarios.",

To investigate the views of the users, we designed a questionnaire and collected the responses of 114 participants. The results show that participants are concerned about the collateral information collection and in particular about the lack of notification and of mechanisms to control the data collection.

        "abstract": "Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are the internal mechanism used in many cryptocurrencies to represent coins. Such representation has some clear benefits, but also entails some complexities that, if not properly handled, may leave the system in an inefficient state. Specifically, inefficiencies arise when wallets (the software responsible for transferring coins between parties) do not manage UTXOs properly when performing payments. In this paper, we study three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, by analysing the state of their UTXO sets, that is, the status of their sets of spendable coins. These three cryptocurrencies are the top-3 UTXO-based cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Our analysis shows that the usage of each cryptocurrency presents some differences, and led to different results. Furthermore, it also points out that the management of the transactions has not always been …",

Apps installed by a user’s friends can collect and potentially misuse her personal data inflicting collateral damage on the user while leaving her without proper means of control. In this paper, we present a multi-faceted study on the collateral information collection of apps in social networks. We conduct a user survey and show that Facebook users are concerned about this issue and the lack of mechanisms to control it. Based on real data, we compute the likelihood of collateral information collection affecting users; we show that the probability is significant and depends on both the friendship network and the popularity of the app. We also show its significance by computing the proportion of exposed user attributes including the case of profiling, when several apps are offered …",

In federated learning, training is held at end devices, and thus data does not need to leave users’ devices. However, most approaches to federated learning rely on a central server to coordinate the learning process which, in turn, introduces its own security and privacy problems. We propose Federify, a decentralized federated learning framework based on blockchain that employs homomorphic encryption and zero knowledge proofs to provide security, privacy, and transparency. The scheme successfully preserves the confidentiality of both the data used for training and the local models using homomorphic encryption. All model parameters are publicly verifiable using zkSNARKs, and transparency of both the learning process and the incentive mechanism is achieved by delegating …",

Moreover, evaluating the level of compliance requires, in the majority of cases, manually implementing an extensive data analysis. In this paper, we present four new algorithms (CIA, CDA, BDA, and SCA) and a novel measure (WLoC) to evaluate user tracking compliance in websites and the level of confidence in the use of information-gathering technologies, by employing the recently published Website Evidence Collector (WEC) software from the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).

In this paper, we propose BArt, a transparent and distributed mechanism for artists to commercialize their digital artwork, keeping control of the copies, monetizing its usage, and maintaining ownership. BArt allows artists to publicly register their work in the Bitcoin blockchain and sell usage rights in exchange for bitcoins. Buyers are allowed to exert the acquired rights.

For this reason, algorithmic transparency is becoming a pressing need: automated decisions should be explainable and unbiased. A straightforward solution is to make the decision algorithms open-source, so that everyone can verify them and reproduce their outcome. However, in many situations, the source code or the training data of algorithms cannot be published for industrial or intellectual property reasons, as they are the result of long and costly experience (e.g. this is typically the case in banking or insurance). We present an approach whereby individual subjects on whom automated decisions are made can elicit in a collaborative and privacy-preserving manner a rule-based approximation of the model underlying the decision algorithm, based on limited interaction with the algorithm or even only on how they have been …",

        "abstract": "Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer distributed cryptocurrency system, that keeps all transaction history in a public ledger known as blockchain. The Bitcoin network is implicitly pseudoanonymous and its nodes are controlled by independent entities making network analysis difficult. This calls for the development of a fully controlled testing environment. This paper presents Kriptosare.gen, a dockerized automatized Bitcoin testbed, for deploying full-scale custom Bitcoin networks. The testbed is deployed in a single machine executing four different experiments, each one with different network configuration. We perform a cost analysis to investigate how the resources are related with network parameters and provide experimental data quantifying the amount of computational resources needed to run the different types of simulations. Obtained results demonstrate that it is possible to run the testbed with a configuration similar to a …",

On the one hand, previous studies have shown how it is possible to infer private attributes from publicly available data. On the other hand, no distinction exists between public and private data when we consider the ability of the online social network (OSN) provider to access them. Even when OSN users go to great lengths to protect their privacy, such as by using encryption or communication obfuscation, correlations between data may render these solutions useless. In this article, we study the relationship between private communication patterns and publicly available OSN data. Such a relationship informs both privacy-invasive inferences as well as OSN communication modelling, the latter being key toward developing effective obfuscation tools. We propose an inference model based on Bayesian …",

Understanding the topology of the LN is crucial, not only because it is key to performance, but also for ensuring its security and privacy guarantees. The topology of the LN affects, among others, the ability to successfully route payments between nodes, its resilience (against both attacks and random failures), and the privacy of payments. Existing research on LN topology focuses on studying the degree, betweenness, and closeness as metrics that better describe the centrality of nodes. However, to the best of our knowledge, previous studies do not encompass the network as a whole because of the limitation of using only the capacity of channels as its principal property.

En este artículo se describe la experiencia de dos asignaturas de nivel de máster: “Programación para la bioinformática” y “Programación para la Ciencia de Datos”, ambas introductorias a la programación en el lenguaje Python, pero orientadas cada una de ellas a la resolución de los problemas específicos que se plantean en cada uno de estos dos ámbitos.

We describe how to combine these two classifiers to build an Online Social Network (OSN) user classifier and then we evaluate the performance of our architecture by trying to solve two different classification problems (a binary and a multiclass problem) using data extracted from Twitter.

In this paper, we show the feasibility to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain with an IoT device. To this end, we implement a minimal SPV wallet that we deploy on a microcontroller unit from the STM32F4 family.

However, a part from data they provide, other related data can be obtained from users: the relations between them.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces “SmartBLock”, a novel protocol that integrates smart lock management with the Bitcoin blockchain. By employing blockchain technology, the SmartBLock protocol eliminates the need for centralized databases (reducing the risk of data breaches) and ensures accountability for all access events. Authentication is accomplished through Bitcoin's cryptographic signature scheme. Additionally, SmartBLock is an open and manufacturer-agnostic protocol, relying on the open and permissionless Bitcoin blockchain rather than proprietary tools or protocols. Given the limited computational capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, achieving this integration presents a significant challenge. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state of the art in smart lock protocols, details the design of the SmartBLock protocol, presents a proof-of-concept prototype to validate its feasibility, and offers a …",

The protocol leverages on-chain Bitcoin data to handle all aspects of token ownership, including trading, while integrating a secondary consensus system for minting and optionally modifying token metadata. To minimize its on-chain footprint, the protocol utilizes the OP_RETURN mechanism for ownership records, while complementary NFT-related actions are stored on the LAOS blockchain. All data remains permanently on-chain, with no reliance on bridges or third-party operators.",

A growing concern in such settings revolves around model poisoning and data poisoning-how training is conducted and which data contributes to the process. This paper introduces a protective scheme against model and data poisoning attacks. Leveraging cryptographic primitives such as hashes, signature schemes, and zero-knowledge proofs, the scheme ensures the integrity of the training process. Hashing maintains the continuity of data from authenticated sensors, while signatures validate the data. In the end, zero-knowledge proofs verify the correct model computation by the entity carrying out the training process. By adopting this approach, model sponsors can securely delegate training tasks, guaranteeing the authenticity of the results. Implementation and testing demonstrate the …",

The LN can be accessed through different implementations or clients, the most popular being Lightning Network Daemon (LND), Core Lightning Network (CLN), and Eclair. The first step in many known attacks to the LN is to infer the software client the node is running. This paper presents two classification models based on decision trees to infer the implementation of LN clients from either the traffic of the gossip protocol or the announced BOLT #9 features, offering a cost-free means of identification. The accuracy presented by both models in our experiments is high, ranging from 87% to 100% depending on the model and the environment where it is deployed. The application of our inference models on the LN shows a prevalence of LND clients.",

The concept of echo chambers and their influence on social networks has received significant attention in recent academic investigations. Echo chambers are commonly referred to as the digital bubble where users participate in a conversation mostly with like-minded others, and it is usually related not only to homophily but can also be directly associated with the effects of social media algorithms. This study examines the Twitter interactions during two Spanish regional elections. Data collection has been performed through Twitter Streaming API, which resulted in a total dataset of 5.5 million tweets.

Web crawlers can be configured to crawl online social networks (OSNs) to obtain relevant data about their global structure.

These settings define the crawler's behavior and they have a big impact on the collected data. Both the amount of collected data and the quality of the information that it contains are affected by the crawler settings and, therefore, by properly configuring these web crawler settings we can target specific goals to achieve with our crawl.

By using network-based analysis and spatial proximity within ForceAtlas2 layouts, it provides a complementary perspective to traditional approaches (self-placement surveys, CHES and Manifesto analysis). TIDEM is applied to three Spanish regional elections, revealing consistent results through them, and a strong correlation with self-ideological surveys. Key findings indicate higher levels of polarization, likely due to the clustering effects inherent in retweet interactions.

        "abstract": "[EN] Federated Learning (FL) advances privacypreserving machine learning by decentralizing model training to individual devices, ensuring data remains localized. However, FL is not immune to privacy threats. This paper investigates the specific risk of property inference attacks, where an adversary infers whether a certain property is present in the training data, despite this property not being the focus of the global model. Through experiments with TensorFlow Federated, we replicate and extend previous findings on property inference attacks, validating their reproducibility, credibility and robustness. Our analysis reveals two key insights: property inference attacks are highly effective during the initial training rounds due to significant early updates, and the rarity of the property in the dataset enhances attack effectiveness due to greater weight contrast. Our results demonstrate that even without adversarial modifications, significant privacy risks exist in FL systems, highlighting the need for enhanced security measures to protect sensitive information in FL environments.",

In the LN, the payer and the payee do not need to have an open direct channel to transact: they can transact through channels by means of other users of the network, that act as intermediaries for the payments. The parameters of the contracts being used in these multihop payments determine the level of security oﬀered, but also the usefulness of the LN as a payment network. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of tuning the parameters of the contracts for the security and performance of the payment network, and provide recommendations on the values for those parameters, taking into account the trade-oﬀ between network utility and security.",

After proposing a classifier to deal with this problem, we provide extensive experimental evaluation showing that our proposed method is sound and that it is able to achieve high accuracy, in most cases much higher than other already existing algorithms configured to tackle this very same problem. The contributions of this paper are twofold: first, it presents a classifier for interlinked entities that outperforms most of the existing algorithms when the only information available is the relationships between these entities; second, it reveals the power of using label independent (LI) features extracted from network structural properties in the bootstrapping …",

        "abstract": "Third-party applications on Facebook can collect personal data of the users who install them, but also of their friends. This raises serious privacy issues as these friends are not notified by the applications nor by Facebook, and they have not given consent. This paper presents a detailed multi-faceted study of the collateral information collection of the applications on Facebook. To investigate the views of the users, we designed a questionnaire and collected the responses of 114 participants. The results show that participants are concerned about the collateral information collection and in particular about the lack of notification and of mechanisms to control the data collection. Based on real data, we compute the likelihood of collateral information collection affecting users: we show that the probability is significant and greater than 80% for popular applications such as TripAdvisor. We also demonstrate that a substantial amount of profile data can be collected by applications, which enables application providers to profile users. To investigate whether collateral information collection is an issue to users’ privacy we analysed the legal framework in light of the new General Data Protection Regulation. We provide a detailed analysis of the entities involved and investigate which entity is accountable for the collateral information collection. To provide countermeasures, we propose a privacy dashboard extension that implements privacy scoring computations to enhance transparency towards collateral information collection. Furthermore, we discuss alternative solutions highlighting other countermeasures such as notification and access control mechanisms …",

        "abstract": "Les xarxes socials en línia (en anglès, Online Social Networks o OSNs) són avui en dia un dels serveis més populars a Internet. En el moment d'escriure aquestes línies, quatre de les deu primeres pàgines del rànquing global Alexa corresponien a xarxes socials i les xarxes més utilitzades tenien centenars de milions d'usuaris actius cada dia. Les persones fem servir xarxes socials per compartir tot tipus de continguts: des d'atributs personals (com noms, edat o sexe), a ubicacions, fotos o comentaris. D'altra banda, les xarxes socials es caracteritzen per permetre que els usuaris puguin crear relacions de manera explícita (per exemple, relacions d'amistat). A més, les xarxes socials inclouen no només la informació que els usuaris publiquen conscientment sobre si mateixos, sinó també la informació que es genera a partir de la interacció dels usuaris de la plataforma. Tant el nombre d'usuaris com el volum de dades compartides fan que la privacitat en xarxes socials sigui crítica. Aquesta tesi se centra en l'estudi de la privacitat en xarxes socials en dos contextos diferents: l'adquisició de dades de manera automatitzada (crawling) i l'aprenentatge. En primer lloc, s'estudia la relació entre crawling i privacitat, un tema que fins al moment ha rebut una atenció limitada. Aquest escenari és interessant ja que és assequible fins i tot per a un atacant de baix pressupost. En segon lloc, s'estudia com extreure informació de les relacions que formen els usuaris de xarxes socials. Les tècniques desenvolupades s'estenen després al tractament d'altres problemes que, com les xarxes socials, es poden modelar en forma de grafs.",

We evaluate the current approaches to the edge selection problem for relational classification. These approaches are based on defining a metric over the graph that quantifies the goodness of a specific link type. We propose a new metric to achieve this very same goal. Experimental results show that our proposed metric outperforms the existing ones.",

Como veremos a lo largo de este módulo, dichos sistemas engloban en realidad un vasto número de conceptos, técnicas y herramientas que son a menudo difíciles de definir de manera aislada. De hecho, incluso la utilización del término intruso es a veces mal interpretada en la literatura. El concepto de intruso es utilizado por lo general para caracterizar acciones cometidas por usuarios no autorizados que violan la política de seguridad y logran introducirse de manera ilícita en un sistema. Aun así, los IDS no se limitan a descubrir únicamente la fase final de una entrada no autorizada en un sistema, sino que por lo general abarcan también mecanismos capaces de tratar las fases previas a una intrusión, así como muchas otras acciones hostiles contra un sistema, llegando incluso a permitir el tratamiento de cualquier otra tarea que pueda ser considerada como potencialmente peligrosa o con un comportamiento fuera de lo común (respecto al funcionamiento normal del sistema).Aunque existen, en general, dos grandes categorías de IDS en el mercado, según si su proceso de detección se centra directamente en el tratamiento del flujo de datos de una red (conocidos como NIDS, o sobre las tareas ejecutadas a nivel de equipo (conocidos como HIDS), en este módulo nos centraremos únicamente en los IDS a nivel de red. Veremos también que el proceso de detección puede resumirse en dos modalidades principales. Por un lado, diferenciaremos los mecanismos de detección que realizan un proceso de análisis …",
